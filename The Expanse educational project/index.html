          In a future where humanity has colonized the solar system, Jim Holden,
          an ice hauler, and Miller, a detective on the asteroid belt, become
          involved in a conspiracy that threatens to destroy the entire system.
          The duo uncovers a mysterious alien protomolecule that has infected a
          research station, and they must work together to stop a larger
          conspiracy that could lead to war. Along the way, they encounter a
          wide range of characters, including an Earther politician, a Martian
          marine, and a rogue ship captain.

          solar system. As the different factions race to claim control over the
